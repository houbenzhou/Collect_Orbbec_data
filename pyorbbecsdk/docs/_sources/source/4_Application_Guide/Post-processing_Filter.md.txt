# Post-Processing Filter

The Gemini 330 series supports post-processing filters. For more information, see post_process.py.

```python
from pyorbbecsdk import *
config = Config()
pipeline = Pipeline()
#Get a list of post-processing filtering recommendations
filter_list = depth_sensor.get_recommended_filters()
# Call the enabled filters in the recommend list in turn
post_filter = filter_list[i]
new_depth_frame = post_filter.process(depth_frame)
```
